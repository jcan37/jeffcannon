### Step 2: Do a retro

Think about and learn from your past year using three columns:

What worked? | What didn't work? | What improvements do you want to make for next time?

Creators have to take a lot of swings and inevitably miss on many. But if you commit to learning after every swing, then 5 years from now you will be unstoppable. Retros ensure that you learn after every swing.

Use problem statements for the middle column. "I need \_\_\_\_" is not a problem. It's a solution. What is the underlying problem? A need statement is not a problem statement. Why do you need it? Get behind the symptom. Find the problem.

Here's my retro for 2020:

**What worked?**

* *Went from 183 pounds to 167 pounds in weight.*
* *Quit drinking.*
* *Ate more fruits and vegetables.*
* *Did physical rehab for my shoulder.*
* *Got an annual physical and bloodwork done for the first time in many years.*
* *Doubled savings in a year.*
* *String Theory was launched.*
* *We had over 10 customers and 2 repeat customers.*
* *We partnered with GLE to teach kids how to string at a lacrosse camp.*
* *Learned how to better to do e-commerce and using Shopify now to reduce our workload.*
* *We have over 170 followers on Instagram.*
* *Listened to/read at least 10 books.*
* *Spending quiet time free of distractions with myself daily.*
* *Learned about film editing.*
* *Built a pergola for my family.*
* *Setup a home gym.*
* *Bought a car.*
* *Bitcoin and Tesla were great investments.*

**What didn't work?**

* *Not sleeping well. Falling asleep late and not getting enough sleep.*
* *Never got into a physical hobby like yoga or martial arts which are more functional forms of moving the body.*
* *Bad money management in the stock market by selling stocks in March when they were getting crushed and buying too much into SPY put options.*
* *Helmet shields were an unnecessary investment for String Theory.*
* *String Theory is not meeting its promises of transparency and trust.*
* *String Theory can be marketed better.*
* *String Theory needs to support and attract more stringers on the platform if we want make more money.*
* *Living at home is stressful.*

**What improvements do you want to make for next time?**

* *Focus on getting to sleep earlier and at least 7 hours per night.*
* *Get a membership for yoga or martial arts classes so that I’m losing money if I don’t go.*
* *Only sell stock for liquidity. Don’t trust your assumptions about what the market is going to do in the near future.*
* *Find more living situations outside of home this year even if it costs you more money than you'd like to spend.*
* *Develop stringer pages and better support stringers on the platform to have their own brands and product offerings.*
* *Do giveaways on Instagram to grow String Theory awareness.*
* *Don’t worry about making profit in String Theory yet. Focus on getting more revenue.*
