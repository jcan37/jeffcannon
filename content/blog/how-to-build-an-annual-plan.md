title: How to build an annual plan

With 2021 approaching soon, now's the time when people typically set New Year's resolutions. I've never liked New Year's resolutions. Something about waiting for a specific time of year to make changes that will benefit you always rubbed me the wrong way. The best time for change is always right now, no matter what time of year.

This year however, I am inspired to create an annual plan for myself. The source of this inspiration is this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ex5OfbutUQ) from Jack Conte, CEO of Patreon, outlining his method for building an annual plan. It is fucking awesome and worth a watch. 

Why should anyone make an annual plan?

1. **Focus**. It is easy to lose focus without a plan.
2. **Know what you want**. I think I know what I want. But any time I have ever sat down and forced myself to write and clarify it, I realize that it is not what I thought it was.
3. **Live your dream**. It is satisfying to have a clear vision of your dream future and to make progress towards it.

I am going through the steps outlined in the video over the next week and will write about the process here.
