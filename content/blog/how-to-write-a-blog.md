Here’s how I do it:

Before I start writing, I have no idea what I’m going to say. I usually just start by writing every thought that pops into my head. Eventually, that takes me in a direction where I feel compelled to say something.

Now, I don’t think my blog is very good from a marketing standpoint. There’s no singular focus. It’s more of a self-indulgent diary than a useful body of writing for a specific audience.

But I don’t have anything to sell you and I don’t care if you like it.

Maybe you don’t think you have anything to write about, but you might be surprised. I certainly didn’t think I could keep this up for hundreds of pieces but here we are.
