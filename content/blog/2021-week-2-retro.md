**The good**

Although I didn’t get it done as fast as I wanted to, I am really proud of the String Theory design updates and I can’t wait to implement them!

I wrote and published everyday like I promised myself I would (even if it wasn’t good writing).

I finished the first 10 chapters of This Is Marketing and I’m getting so many great insights from this book!

I got my dentist appointment out of the way.

**The bad**

This week kicked my ass and it’s partially my fault. 

I’m stuck in a bad cycle of not getting enough sleep, then sleeping too late, then falling behind on work so that I work late, then falling asleep late. Clearly, I’m not hitting my sleep goals this quarter right now.

I might be trying to pack too much work in. I need time to decompress.

I’m skipping my daily hour-long walks. I miss them as they are a necessary break from all the noise.

I’m probably spending too much time on my phone.

**Looking ahead**

This weekend I am correcting my sleep. I’m going to go to bed early Saturday night to get on track.

Carefully plan work this week. Maybe plan 20% less than I think I can do.

Even if I don’t feel like I have time, it is better to walk for at least 15 minutes than to skip it entirely.

Does my phone need to be on during the day? Maybe I can just shut it off. I can definitely at least stop using it for looking at my to-do list.
