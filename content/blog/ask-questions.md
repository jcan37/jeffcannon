[How to build an annual plan](https://jeffcannon.dev/blog/how-to-build-an-annual-plan/)

**Step 1: Ask questions**

The first step to building an annual plan is to ask yourself questions and answer them freely. 

* What do you want? What matters to you? What doesn’t matter to you?
* What are you best at as an individual?
* Why are you doing what you’re doing? Why does it matter?
* What do you think attracts people to your work?
* What are your fans like? What do they get from your work?
* What do you want to be doing in 5 years?

Just brain dump answers to these questions. Do not filter or organize your thoughts until step 4.
