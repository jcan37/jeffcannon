I am the founder and Chief Theorist of String Theory.

I was an All-American lacrosse player for Northport High School. My first job was working as a retail employee and stringer for Lacrosse Unlimited in Huntington where I worked part-time for 5 years.

I was recruited to a few colleges after high school but got into UVA without being committed there and decided it was the best place for me. I considered walking on to the team but thought it might be too difficult to balance lacrosse with a computer engineering degree. Instead, I played for the club lacrosse team while in college.

Combining my knowledge in lacrosse stringing and technical know-how as a computer engineer, I designed and developed String Theory with the intent of creating the easiest way for lacrosse stringers and players to connect.
