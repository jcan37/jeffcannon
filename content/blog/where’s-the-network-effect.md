description: How does your product or service get better as more people use it?
  You want to create something with this property so that people are
  incentivized to selfishly share it. They tell their friends because it makes
  your product or service work better for them if their friends use it too.

I’ve already spoken of referral links but there’s nothing exciting about that. It seems like every company uses them now so it doesn’t give us any sort of edge. But how exactly are we going to do referral links? I think free stringing credits seems like a good idea. Stringers can opt into adding this feature where players who write a review can share their profile with friends and if anyone new signs up, both players get free stringing. They just have to pay for materials.

Team orders are another useful feature that I have talked about already. We can make our service more affordable at scale and incentivize players to tell their teammates about String Theory. I have ideas for UX/UI around this concept similar to Kickstarter that could gamify this.
