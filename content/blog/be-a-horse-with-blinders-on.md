Race horses are adorned with blinders to block out their rear and peripheral vision. This keeps them focused and on track.

It’s tempting to take a peak over the fence at what your neighbor has, but this will ruin you. You can never take the lead if you’re always looking at what others are doing.

The only person you should be competing against is yourself. Be a little bit better today than you were yesterday. Small changes compound. You will reach your highest potential.
