When you do talk numbers in a negotiation, use odd numbers. Rounded numbers feel like placeholders that can be easily negotiated away from. Odd numbers feel specific and calculated.

When it comes to sales, you can use the same strategy for pricing depending on the image you want your brand to have. If you want your customers to feel like they are getting the lowest possible price, use odd numbers. If youâ€™re going for more of a premium feel, use even numbers.
