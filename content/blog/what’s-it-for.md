What makes String Theory different?

I bounced around a few different answers to this question. Maybe we could be more affordable, faster, higher quality, or more convenient than competitors.

[Affordability](https://jeffcannon.dev/blog/dont-start-with-price/) is a lazy way to differentiate oneself so I threw that idea out first. Fast is hard to guarantee with a platform of independent stringers so I eliminated that as well. That left me with higher quality and easier. While I like the idea of offering something premium and want to do high-quality work, I think it’s much better for us to focus on doing one thing really well: make it easy.

Reducing friction is a theme that many internet businesses have adopted and done successfully. Considering we are entering a market with old school players where our advantage is my technical aptitude, it makes a lot of sense for us to start here.

The standard process for getting a stick strung if you don’t know someone who does it is to go to a brick and mortar shop and drop your stick off or buy a new one. What would it look like if you could just press a button and have a new one? That’s what String Theory is for.
