Creating a successful business requires two distinct functions: building and selling.

**Build:** Focus on the product. Fund research and development. Create the business inside out.

**Sell:** Focus on the message. Fund marketing and advertising. Create the business outside in. 

You shouldn't expect to succeed having one without the other. However, founders usually start with one since it is rare for a founder to be naturally good at both initially. 

Starting with either can work but if you can choose to start with one, start with building. It's easier to transition from being a builder to a seller than a seller to a builder.
