Perfectionism is an insidious form of procrastination.

It feels productive and you think it’s okay that you haven’t released that thing you’ve been working on yet because it’s not quite perfect yet. But it will never be perfect. And you are pushing off the opportunity to receive feedback because you are afraid of how you will be judged.

I haven’t written in two weeks and I’m beginning to feel it. I’m not sure what to write and I keep pushing it off because I don’t want to write something embarrassingly bad.

If you don’t push through the bad work, you’ll never get to the great work.

There’s no way to grow faster than having a willingness to fall on your face in public. So start somewhere and ship the damn thing.
