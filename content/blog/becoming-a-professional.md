For the majority of my life I have been an amateur. I like making things. I think I even have a propensity to do it well. I fantasize about creating a successful business with this talent. But I've been flaky. I haven't showed up everyday. I show up when I feel inspired. And if I don't change, I will always be an amateur.

The reason I write this blog even though no one is reading it is because I need to prove to myself that I can show up. Because that's what professionals do. They don't wait for inspiration. If you wait for inspiration, you will never develop enough skill to be good enough for the market you seek to serve.

So here I am even though I don't feel like it. Grinding through mediocre work. Dragging you with me if you care to read. And I'll be here tomorrow and every other day after that. Because I don't want to be an amateur anymore. I want to be a professional.
