Whether they're aware of it or not, most people care about status.

In a future world where machines do most of the grunt work and everybody has a basic income to meet their needs, money loses its effectiveness at elevating one’s status.

How can we prepare for this future?

First, making a lot of money shouldn’t be your goal. Make enough to cover your means and then some but don’t stress about acquiring much more than that. 

People are going to care less that you’re rich or that you have nice stuff. Some people may even judge you for how you don’t help enough people with your money. We can already see aspects of this future in some pockets of the world—it’s just not evenly distributed yet.

Second, while physical resources become abundant, attention is maintaining its scarcity. Get ready to compete for it in the world of ideas. 

Learn as many skills as you can. Be as competent as you can be. Try to entertain or build. Work to create something great and give it away for free. The attention is worth more than any money you can make from it.
