I read and write everyday. I work out everyday. I work my day job. I work on my side hustle. Everyday. 

Most of these things are not required but they sometimes feel like obligations. It’s easy to forget to have fun when you don’t feel like you have enough time in the day to do everything you want to do.

It’s great to be ambitious but don’t forget to enjoy the “now”. Not later. If you’re postponing happiness for the future, that day will never come. If you can’t have fun with it now then it’s not worth doing.

Maybe you need to change what you’re doing. Or maybe you just need to adjust your perspective. Enjoy your life right now.
