This is another gem from Matthew McConaughey’s new book *Greenlights*.

**Less impressed.** Don’t overthink it. Don’t be a spectator. Let the past go.

**More involved.** Participate. Be present. Continuously improve. Do work that inspires you.

It’s okay to celebrate your wins and grieve your losses now and then, but don’t overindulge in these moments. If you linger, you can get stuck.

Don’t mind the result. Get carried away with the process. 

Less impressed, more involved.
