Deadlines regularly make people say and do impulsive things that are against their best interests because we all have a natural tendency to rush as a deadline approaches.

The thing about deadlines though is that they are often arbitrary, almost always flexible, and hardly ever trigger the consequences we think they will.

Keep this mantra in mind when considering the time pressure to make a deal: “No deal is better than a bad deal.” Willingness to walk away will give you an edge in negotiations.

A good negotiator resists the urge to meet a deadline and takes advantage of this natural tendency in others.
