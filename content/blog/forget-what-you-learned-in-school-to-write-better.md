If you want to be sure that almost nobody reads your writing, write like an academic. If, instead, you actually want to communicate ideas to an audience:

1. Replace ten dollar words with ten cent words. If someone needs a dictionary to understand you then you have already lost them.
2. Use less words. There’s no minimum page limit. Most people only have the time and attention for a few sentences so make them count!

I still fall into these traps more often than I’d like. Old habits die hard, I guess. However, use these two rules of thumb to unbrainwash yourself of the bad writing habits you learned in school.
