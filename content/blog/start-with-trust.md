Do you trust others? What about someone you just met? People generally fall into one of two camps with regards to trust:

In the first camp, your trust must be earned. You don't let your guard down until somebody has proven to be trustworthy. 

In the second, you assume everyone is trustworthy from the outset until proven otherwise. This is more likely to lead to situations where somebody screws you over. But the upside of having this stance is that you are more likely to form better relationships with others. And have you ever considered that other people's trustworthiness may depend on your inclination to trust them in the first place? 

I heard this [idea](https://tim.blog/2020/11/30/jim-collins-returns/) from Jim Collins and it made me realize that I am someone who falls in the first camp. But I'm convinced that it is better to be in the second.
