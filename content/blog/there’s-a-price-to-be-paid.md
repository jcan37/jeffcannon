One thing that you don’t expect when chasing your dreams is that while you may make a bunch of strangers like you a little more, you’ll also make everyone close to you like you less in the process.

You become boring because you obsess over the thing you’re chasing. It’s the only thing you want to talk about. You know this and try to talk about other things but realize you don’t stay up-to-date on anything else anymore.

You’re emotionally unavailable. There are always deadlines to hit and you don’t have time to catch up with people. God forbid something unexpected comes up and ruins your tightly planned schedule.

Even if you end up achieving what you set out to do, people close to you will be jealous of your success. Your success makes them feel inadequate. No one will admit this of course. They’ll try to write off your success as luck. Surely, luck did have a role to play but nobody will respect all the hard work that was required too.

Chasing your dreams is lonely. Or maybe it’s just me. Maybe I’m an asshole. But maybe there’s someone else out there who can relate.
