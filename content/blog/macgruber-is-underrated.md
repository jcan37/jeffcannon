I just watched *MacGruber* tonight and couldn’t stop laughing the entire movie. Everything is deliberately over-the-top and Will Forte nails the absurdity of his character. 

I was curious after watching the movie what it’s ratings were and only 48% of critics and 35% of the audience liked it.

I’m not sure what people expected but if you’re looking for an easy movie to watch with some ridiculous gags, this movie is it.
