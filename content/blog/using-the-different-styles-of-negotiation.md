title: Using the different styles of negotiation

While it is useful to know which style of negotiation you lean towards, it is even more important to understand the differences between them so you can understand your counterpart better and how to deal with them.

The greatest challenge to identifying someone else’s style is the assumption that many people have that others view the world the same way they do. While that is an innocent and understandable assumption, it is the most damaging one to have in a negotiation. With that assumption, we will unconsciously project our style onto the other person and then be confused why negotiations aren’t going as expected.

When it comes to negotiating, the Golden Rule is wrong. Instead, don’t treat others the way *you want* to be treated; treat them the way *they need* to be treated.
