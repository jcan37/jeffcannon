This week was a little bit better than the last. I published updates to the home page of String Theory and finalized some designs for our upcoming sprint to re-launch.

My sleep is still not great. I’m not working as late as I was a week ago but now I am keeping myself up with my phone or TV so I still need to work on it.

I finished reading *This Is Marketing* by Seth Godin this weekend and I LOVED the ending! I liked this book more than *The Practice*. I felt like I really needed to hear its message. It helped me see how selfish I was being in the creation of my business. I may not like marketing but it doesn’t matter if I don’t like it because it isn’t for me. I have to do it so that the important work that I’m doing is seen by the right people in a way that resonates with their own personal story.

My birthday was this past week and it was a good one. I had a nice dinner with Em at Crown Shy in the Financial District and got to see some friends on Tuesday and this past Saturday.

In this upcoming week, I will be grinding into more development of the re-launch of String Theory. Specifically, I’m trying to get our new shop page completely implemented with CMS on Contentful. I will also be starting a new book: *Unreasonable Success and How to Achieve It* by Richard Koch. Fingers crossed for better sleeping habits.
