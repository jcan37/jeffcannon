It's almost midnight and I've been driving all day from Orlando to Richmond, VA. I'm exhausted but I haven't written yet so I need to write something.

Couldn't I just skip one day? Absolutely not. Think about the shame you will feel tomorrow if you do. It's all or nothing. Professional or amateur.

Keep the streak alive.
