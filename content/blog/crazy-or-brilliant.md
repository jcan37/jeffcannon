In the present moment, there is little distinction between the beliefs of a crazy person and a brilliant one. It is only clear in retrospect whether someone was crazy.

Lean into your bold ideas that other people think are crazy. Go against the status quo. You can’t know yet if you are crazy or not but if you aren’t willing to have conviction in believing something different, then you will certainly turn out to be unremarkable.
