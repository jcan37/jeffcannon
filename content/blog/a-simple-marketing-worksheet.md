At the end of This Is Marketing by Seth Godin, there is a section titled “A Simple Marketing Worksheet” with a series of questions. 

Rather than try to summarize the entire book in a few posts, I think it might be more fun to go through these questions over the next couple of weeks and apply it to my business, String Theory:

* Who’s it for?
* What’s it for?
* What is the worldview of the audience you’re seeking to reach?
* What are they afraid of?
* What story will you tell? Is it true?
* What change are you seeking to make?
* How will it change their status?
* How will you reach the early adopters and neophiliacs?
* Why will they tell their friends?
* What will they tell their friends?
* Where’s the network effect that will propel this forward?
* What asset are you building?
* Are you proud of it?

Starting with “Who’s it for?” tomorrow.
