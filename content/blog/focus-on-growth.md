As a business owner competing against many alternatives, the natural inclination is to steal market share. Cut down your competitors and certainly don’t promote them. Advertise why customers should choose you instead of them. This seems like a reasonable thing to do if you want to survive and thrive.

But what if this inclination is wrong? I think it is and it’s certainly not how I want to operate my business. “Better” is subjective and the customers you seek to serve will always choose you assuming the kind of “better” you’re offering aligns with what they’re looking for. If you aren’t providing the best that they’re looking for, don’t be dishonest. Do better.

An issue that you and your competitors share is the total available market for what you all do. Instead of trying to corner the market, focus on growing the market. It may be most effective to do this by working with your competitors, not against them.
