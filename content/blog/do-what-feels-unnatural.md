Through recent experiences trying boxing and marketing, it has come to my attention that I avoid doing things that I don’t initially have a knack for.

I never thought I had an issue with doing hard things. To some extent, I still think that is true with activities I consider myself good at. But I realize now that I definitely avoid things that don't come naturally to me and try to hide from them.

This time, I’m going to stick to the activities I’m bad at. It’s embarrassing and feels unnatural but I feel it is important to my growth as a person.
