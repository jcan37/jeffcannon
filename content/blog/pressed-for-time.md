It’s hard for me to keep up with everything I want to do. I often get overwhelmed because of commitments my past self made for my present self.

It’s important to be consistent but not everything requires my full energy and attention all of the time.

When time is short, it’s okay to do the bare minimum on tasks that aren’t the highest priority. Not everything has to be your best work.
