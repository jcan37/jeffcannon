Starting a relationship is like growing a plant. The early days are the most fragile. You need to provide just the right amount of care. Too much or too little will result in its death. 

I have a tendency to overwater my plants and drown them.

If you’re a romantic, the best thing you can do when you’re in doubt about a person you like is shut the fuck up. Keep your feelings to yourself.

I generally like being an open book and I think there’s virtue in that. Unfortunately, there are some circumstances where it isn’t in your best interest.
