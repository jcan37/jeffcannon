**The good**

The MVP for our String Theory platform is so close to being ready for launch. Last month, I was a bit disappointed with my original designs but as it is coming together, I am starting to love it. I hope our audience agrees.

I moved into Seaford and have setup my room to be well-suited for productivity. I lost a bit of time that could have been spent elsewhere for String Theory but it is the best room I’ve ever had.

**The bad**

Aside from creating my theorist Instagram and taking some pictures, I did not spend any time marketing this month. I need to pick this up next month.

My sleep is still a struggle. I’m starting to question whether it’s worth stressing over. Elon Musk, a significant role model, does not seem to care too much about sleeping a lot and I’m starting to consider that path as well. I will give it another month to aim for better sleep but also try to stress less about it being perfect.

**Looking ahead**

This is a huge month for String Theory. We will be re-launching our MVP and picking up steam with our marketing. I’m prepared to invest heavily into gaining exposure and we should see a lot of increased interest this month.
