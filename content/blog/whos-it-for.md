It can’t be for everyone. If it’s made for everyone, it won't be good enough for anyone.

What’s the minimum viable audience? The more specific I can be about who it's for, the easier it will be for me to have a clear idea of who I’m marketing to.

Since String Theory is a marketplace, it has two buckets of “shareholders” in the business that we are trying to simultaneously serve: stringers and players. Let’s talk about who each one is separately.

**Stringers**

These are individuals who currently offer their services a la carte on Instagram or some other online medium. They are not tech savvy and if they have a site, it is most likely a boilerplate one setup with a website builder. They may be struggling to grow their stringing business or make a living with it. Possibly, they work for a retail store at the moment but they are interested in getting paid more for their work. They can drive and are willing to offer pickup and delivery to local players.

**Players**

String Theory makes it easy to get a new lacrosse stick or your current stick restrung by a professional you can trust. The players we serve are willing to pay a little extra for this convenience and peace of mind. They prefer connecting with a stringer directly rather than working with a retail store chain. Maybe that stringer plays lacrosse with them or their kids and they have a personal connection with them.
