Where do ideas come from? They don’t seem to come from the conscious self. If they did, we could summon good ideas when we needed them.

If you get lucky and a good idea pops into your head from the ether, get it in writing immediately. Good ideas are a precious gift that will be forgotten and wasted if they aren’t written down.

If you have bad thoughts, write those down as well. It is clearly not for the purpose of remembering them but writing your thoughts out also helps clear your head. Inbox zero is a relaxing state to be in.

In either case, your brain is a terrible place to keep thoughts or ideas. So write them down!
