A network effect is a phenomenon in which the value or utility a user derives from a good or service depends on the number of people using it.

Social media companies like Facebook or Twitter are fueled by this phenomenon. Network effects provide a nice moat to prevent anyone from creating an alternative. These services are only valuable because your friends use it. They have little to no inherent value without their users.

I think alcohol thrives similarly. I challenge you to come up with an inherently valuable aspect to drinking. Alcohol is only fun to drink as long as your friends are doing it too. Once you come to this conclusion, it makes it much easier to quit or at least reduce intake.
