How do people generally interact with you? Are they friendly or rude? Do you feel like you get what you want out of life or does life feel like it's constantly holding you back?

The world is a mirror. People reflect your attitude back to you. Those who interact with it positively are rewarded and those who don't get screwed. 

Your engagement with the world is a feedback loop. The more positive you are, the better your life is and the more positive you end up being because of it. The more negative you are, the worse your life gets and the more jaded and cynical you become. I've been there and it is a scary place to be.

If you are stuck in a place like that, the first thing you need to do to get out is take responsibility for your circumstances. Acknowledge that your perspective of the world is negative. Then force yourself to be positive. Work on yourself. Smile more. Assume the best of others. Be kind even though you don't feel like it.

At first, being positive will feel like it's not working. You'll be friendly to others and they will still be cold to you. The world is not rewarding you for being positive yet. That's because your negative energy is still there. It's subtly radiating from your body language. 

Don't give up though. If you can get through this difficult stage of the process, eventually you will make it to the other side as a positive person who can get everything they want from life.
