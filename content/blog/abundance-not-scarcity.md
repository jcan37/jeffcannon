Most people think in terms of win-lose or zero sum. If I get one, then you have to lose one. It leads to tribalism and pettiness.

But win-lose thinking is unsustainable. It only helps some people in the short-run and hurts everyone in the long-run. I have an optimistic view of the future that I think we can achieve if more people can adopt a win-win mentality.

It is counterintuitive. We are wired to compete and fight over resources. Historically, it might have been a good idea to do so. But we are on the cusp of a remarkable transition as a species.

Either human beings will be extinct in the next century or we’re going to level up. I know that people are suffering all over the world but things are getting **exponentially** better. We will be able to see it in our lifetimes. Everyone can be rich.

If we’re going to make it, we need more people to adopt this mentality of win-win. Win-lose isn’t an accurate assessment of our current state and it holds you and the world back.

Think win-win, not win-lose.
