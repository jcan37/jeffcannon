I believe that no matter who you are, you should try to learn to code. Just try it. Even if you only understand a little bit. It’s the most worthwhile skill to have in the world we all live in now.

Unless the world drastically changes for worse, knowing how to code **guarantees** you a good life. Being a software engineer is not very demanding yet extremely rewarding. 

Of course, you can make it more demanding depending on where you work but at that point, it’s no longer about the money and it is just about a sense of purpose. It is such a privilege to have that option.

If you can also learn how to sell, you are unstoppable. I’m currently stuck trying to learn this second one. It does not come naturally to me. But with both of these skills, you can possibly acquire an extraordinary life.
