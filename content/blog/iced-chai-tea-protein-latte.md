description: Hey, y’all. Em here. Tonight I have the honor of taking over Jeff’s
  blog. I thought long and hard about how I was going to take advantage of this
  platform. Of course, my gut reaction is to talk about all things social work.
  To somehow persuade you all to give a shit about the causes that I hold close
  to my heart. But I don’t think that is what I am going to do tonight. You see,
  the thing is, social work is exhausting. Don’t get me wrong, it is my dream
  job and there is nothing else I would rather be doing, but damn it sure takes
  a whole lot out of you. Although it has not even been two years since I
  started my MSW program, I have learned very quickly how important is it for me
  to indulge in my other interests once I leave my clients. If I am being
  perfectly honest I feel like a sell-out for not following through with my
  original plan of enlightening the world about the social injustices that occur
  daily, but my heart and brain need a break to recharge.

Hey, y’all. Em here. Tonight I have the honor of taking over Jeff’s blog. I thought long and hard about how I was going to take advantage of this platform. Of course, my gut reaction is to talk about all things social work. To somehow persuade you all to give a shit about the causes that I hold close to my heart. But I don’t think that is what I am going to do tonight. You see, the thing is, social work is exhausting. Don’t get me wrong, it is my dream job and there is nothing else I would rather be doing, but damn it sure takes a whole lot out of you. Although it has not even been two years since I started my MSW program, I have learned very quickly how important is it for me to indulge in my other interests once I leave my clients. If I am being perfectly honest I feel like a sell-out for not following through with my original plan of enlightening the world about the social injustices that occur daily, but my heart and brain need a break to recharge. So with that extremely personal and lengthy introduction, I will now share with you all my go-to breakfast drink these days:

**Iced Chai Tea Protein Latte**

Let me give you three reasons why this drink is worth trying. It’s only three ingredients. It’s SUGAR-FREE. It takes virtually no time to prepare. Bonus reason for my ADHD/anxiety-prone friends out there, it is less caffeine than coffee so there is less of a chance it will ruin your day. 

Here’s what you need:

* Sugar-free chai tea concentrate. My favorite (and the only brand that I’ve been able to find) is Oregon Chai. 
* Your milk of choice. My favorite is unsweetened vanilla almond milk.
* Finally, the secret touch that makes this drink stand out from the rest, is collagen protein powder. I will give you another little secret. My go-to was always Vital Proteins but I have recently discovered that Whole Foods makes an exact dupe for half the cost. You’re welcome.

Now, my final piece of advice is to prepare this drink in a protein shaker bottle. The protein can glob up a bit which is so not sexy, but I’ve found that when I shake it with that little coil inside it is as smooth as butter. I also like to then transfer the final product into a different cup over ice to really knock it out of the ballpark. 

If you are still here, thank you for sticking around this long. There is no way you needed to read all that fluff, but hey we all like to hear ourselves talk every now and again right?
