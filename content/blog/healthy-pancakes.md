To make healthy pancakes, you need:

* 1-2 servings of Kodiak pancake mix
* 3/4 cup of Greek yogurt (use plain non-fat for less calories)
* 1 egg
* Milk (enough to get your desired consistency)
* 1-2 servings of your choice of fruit. Some recommendations: blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, bananas

Mix those ingredients together and cook your pancakes in a frying pan with some butter. I use about a tablespoon of butter for the entire batch. For toppings, I like to use sugar-free syrup and some whipped cream.

What you end up with is a meal that is under 700 calories and about 50 grams of protein. Scale up or down to suit your calorie needs.

Eating to lose weight doesn't have to suck. You can have your pancake and eat it too.
