I really enjoyed [this conversation](https://tim.blog/2021/05/19/chip-wilson/) between Tim Ferriss and Chip Wilson, founder of Lululemon. When he turned 60, he asked his dad what his advice would be to his 60-year-old self and after a day of thinking about it, here’s what he said:

> Do it now. Do it right fucking now.

I loved this response. I’m relatively young right now and it’s easy to waste time when you feel like you have so much of it. But life is shorter than any of us would like it to be. 

Don’t save the life you want to live for a future when you imagine you will have more security and freedom. Whatever it is that you want to do, do it before you feel ready. 

Do it now. Do it right fucking now.
