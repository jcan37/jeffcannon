I really feel like I’m losing steam here.

When I first started this exercise of writing everyday after reading *The Practice* by Seth Godin, I felt like I was making progress. I thought my writing was getting better.

Now, I feel unsure. I feel like I’m hitting a wall. I feel like I’ve exhausted all of the interesting things I might have to say and I can’t keep up.
