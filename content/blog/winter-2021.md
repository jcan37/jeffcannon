Kicking off 2021 with a bang! Here’s my plan for the first quarter of this year. 

**Health:**

* Cut weight from 166 to 163 pounds in the first 3 weeks
* Improve sleep

  * Consistently wake up at 8AM
  * Average 7 hours per night
* Maintenance

  * Dentist appointment in January
  * Annual checkup in February
  * Daily exercise, fruits & vegetables

**Wealth:**

* String Theory development:

  * Theorist profiles by the end of January
  * Customer accounts & subscriptions by the end of February
  * Customer reviews by the end of March
* String Theory marketing:

  * Create personal lacrosse stringing Instagram in February
  * Do a giveaway for the month of March

**Wisdom:**

* Write & publish everyday
* Walk without phone/distractions for an hour per day
* Read 3 books: [This Is Marketing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0525540830), [Unreasonable Success and How to Achieve It](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1642011363), [The Personal MBA](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591845572)

The purpose of getting this in writing is a) this blog is my diary and b) hopefully it will inspire anyone seeking a similar path in life. Each Sunday I will post a progress update.
