title: Are you proud of it?
description: Marketing works and feels best when you have something that is
  worth sharing. Once you have done the work of being specific about “who’s it
  for” and “what’s it for”, the job of the marketer is to capture the attention
  of the people you serve so they can reap the benefits of your offering.

I am proud of what we are doing with String Theory. We are doing what I think every great business should be doing: reducing friction. If you can successfully reduce friction in a market, those savings can be passed on to the producers and consumers of the market.

In String Theory’s case, we can pay the stringers more for their work compared to traditional brick and mortar shops and make it easier for players to get a high-quality lacrosse stick to play with. It’s very niche but the minimum viable audience is big enough for us to do meaningful work.
