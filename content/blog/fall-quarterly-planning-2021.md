**Summer 2021 Retro**

This quarter was pretty lackluster overall. I should be more on top of my game and I need to reduce the distractions I am allowing into my life.

My *health* goals were somewhat satisfied. I wanted to drop weight to 165 lbs, box weekly, and eat dinner at home at least 3 times per week. The last two goals were met but my first one to drop weight was not. I am 169 lbs at the moment.

My *wealth* goals were very poorly met this quarter. I wanted to finish building the String Theory dashboard for theorists, build a review system into String Theory, onboard 5 more theorists to the site, get 10 new customers to try String Theory, and string 1 head for sale per week. 

Of the site development goals I had, I only got authentication working for the dashboard and didn’t even come close to starting work on reviews. We onboarded 6 new theorists this quarter and I stuck to the weekly head commitment but missed on the number of new customers I wanted to work with.

The thing that slowed me down a lot was onboarding theorists and responding to a lot of messages from them. I need to have notifications turned off and check them in batches. I also shouldn’t be offering to do so many different things for them right now when the site needs a lot of work.

My *wisdom* goals for this quarter were to write only once per week instead of the daily commitment I had before so I could focus better (ironically, I didn’t focus better), do a daily meditative walk, and read *The Ultimate Sales Machine*, *Influence*, and *Man’s Search For Meaning*. I stuck to the weekly writing schedule but was not consistent about doing the meditative walk. I also fell behind on the reading, read Animal Farm instead of finishing Influence, and still have to finish Man’s Search For Meaning.

**Fall 2021 Plan**

For my *health* goals this quarter, I am rolling over my goal to lose a few pounds from last quarter. I’m increasing the target to 167 lbs so it’s only 2 lbs that I need to lose—no excuses! I am also committing to taking a daily greens and fish oil supplement. That’s it for health this quarter. There’s not much here but I think I’ve gotten myself into a pretty good place with my overall health.

For *wealth*, the first goal I have here is to reduce spending in preparation for leaving my day job next year. I’m planning to commit to String Theory full-time before next lacrosse season and without the income from my day job, it is going to be a big adjustment. I need to analyze how much I’m currently spending, then implement a plan to reduce spending now before I no longer have a day job. 

In terms of String Theory development, I committed to too many features last quarter and I don’t think I need to be focusing on new features right now. Instead, I should be focusing on tools for theorists to do more things for themselves and cleaning up the site to support scaling to many more theorists.

For the String Theory business, I want to offer weekly free stringing to plant seeds for my personal stringing business here on Long Island. I also have a large batch of brand new heads that need to be strung and listed on the site. Finally, I’d like to onboard at least another 10 theorists to the site.

My *wisdom* goals are similar to last quarter: I’m going to continue a weekly writing cadence and commit to doing a meditative walk at least on Tuesdays and Thursdays every week. Here’s my reading list: *Influence*, *The Beginning of Infinity*, and *The 48 Laws of Power*.
