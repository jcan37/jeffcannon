Sometimes it is difficult to think of a topic to write about everyday. Idea generation in general can be challenging. There are a couple of tips and tools I use to generate ideas.

1. Keep a notebook of ideas. Write down all of them. Don't worry about deciphering which ones are good or bad. You can pick what's useful later when revisiting them.
2. Spend long periods of time without distractions. At least an hour per day uninterrupted (the length of time is [important](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1261481222359801856?s=20)). No phone, no music, no podcasts. Just you and your thoughts. Bore yourself on purpose. I set a timer for an hour on my watch and like to go for long walks. I also bring a notebook with me in case anything pops into my head that I don't want to forget.
3. Don't force it. My best ideas come when I least expect it. The mind has a tendency to go blank when putting pressure on it to produce an idea.

And if you're worried about using up all of your best ideas, don't be.
