Hi Coach,

I'm sure many of your players are currently getting their sticks strung at a store like Lacrosse Unlimited or String It Up. I used to work at one of these stores and understand how slow the turnaround can be, not to mention having to drive to and from the store to drop off and pick up their stick.

I've decided to go solo and offer lacrosse products and services [here](https://stringtheory.us/jeffcanstring) with FREE pickup & delivery to anywhere on Long Island! Many of the services and products can be fulfilled within the SAME DAY of placing an order.

Would you be opposed to helping me pass this information along to the players and their parents? Attached is a promotion for them to get 20% off their first order with me.

Thanks,

Jeff
