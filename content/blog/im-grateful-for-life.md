This year has been a particularly rough year for many people. But even in the midst of all the chaos and difficult circumstances that are out of our control, today is a reminder that we can always choose to express gratitude.

I'm grateful for a full functioning body. 

I'm grateful to have friends and family to spend my time with.

And I'm grateful that I get to wake up every morning and strive to offer something of value to others.

Happy Thanksgiving!
