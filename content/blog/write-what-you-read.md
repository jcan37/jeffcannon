Just so it’s clear, I don’t know shit about negotiation from personal experience even though I’ve been writing about it a lot lately. 

All of the ideas on negotiation I have written are from *Never Split the Difference* by Chris Voss, an FBI hostage negotiation expert. I don’t credit Chris in every post because it would ruin the flow of my writing but if I’m talking about negotiation I learned it from this book.

Writing down ideas, especially when paraphrased in your own words, makes them easier to remember and implement. I think I will keep doing this indefinitely with other books and recommend the practice to anyone interested in self development.

So here’s a disclaimer going forward in case anyone thinks I’m trying to steal content and pass it off as my own: many of the ideas I write about are not mine. Even the ones that I think are original, probably came from somewhere else.
