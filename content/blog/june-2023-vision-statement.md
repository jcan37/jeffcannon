title: June 2023 vision statement
description: Part of my annual plan for 2022-2023.
---
In 2023, I will be a lean machine running marathons every quarter. Arran and I will travel through Asia and South America speaking Spanish and learning to Salsa dance along the way. We will have a small traveling cold brew and cake business that enables us to meet locals all over the world. I will have a new remote software job making over $200K annual base salary. String Theory will grow to over 100 theorists across North America and over $10K in monthly sales. I will write every week and read a book every month—including one fiction book every quarter. It will be a year of focus on eliminating, automating, and delegating repetitive tasks so I can be a more clear thinker.
