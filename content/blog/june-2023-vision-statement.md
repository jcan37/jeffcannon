title: June 2023 vision statement
description: Part of my annual plan for 2022-2023.
---
I live in Colorado or Texas. Arran and I have traveled to so many cool places all over the world including South America and Asia. I have a remote job as a software engineer for a new company making over $200K annual base salary. String Theory has grown to over $10K in monthly sales and over 100 theorists across North America. We are close to profitability and a position where I feel comfortable committing to work on it full-time. I still read a book per month and write once per week. Besides the usual non-fiction books, Iâ€™ve read some great fiction books this past year. I speak Spanish fluently and learned how to dance with Arran in South America. I run a marathon every 3 months and maintain a high level of fitness. I check-in with family and friends regularly and set up fun trips with all of the people that I love. Arran and I have a traveling cold brew and cake business that enables us to meet locals no matter where we are. It has been an amazing year of adventure and growth!
