Do you wish for a Netflix that has every piece of content that you could ever think of? If so, then you want a [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/).

There are so many options for hardware and different possible setups that it can be a bit overwhelming to get started but here's what I did and I am pretty happy with it:

For hardware, I went with the [Synology DS220+](https://www.amazon.com/Synology-Bay-DiskStation-DS220-Diskless/dp/B087ZCBWFH/) along with a [4TB hard drive](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-IronWolf-5900RPM-Internal-3-5-Inch/dp/B07H289S79/ref=pd_bxgy_img_2/134-7926338-6326519?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07H289S79&pd_rd_r=495fd223-2e20-41c8-9655-80e70bb7b05f&pd_rd_w=CHxaU&pd_rd_wg=q9YbX&pf_rd_p=f325d01c-4658-4593-be83-3e12ca663f0e&pf_rd_r=F2X7H7DB1AKQYDPVMG03&psc=1&refRID=F2X7H7DB1AKQYDPVMG03). Then for setup, I found 2 guides on Reddit specifically for Synology hardware and they are thorough and easy to follow. I started with the [basic setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/comments/eahk68/synology_media_basic_setup_guide/) then worked on the [advanced setup](https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/comments/eahndo/synology_media_advanced_setup_guide/) afterwards.

This has been my favorite thing for Christmas this year.
