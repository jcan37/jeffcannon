I’m pretty close to burnout.

My to-do list is longer than ever. I wouldn’t be so irritated by it if I was also seeing more success. But right now, it feels like I’m doing a lot with little to show for it.

I have a hunch that success is delayed after the onset of good habits. However, it’s difficult to be sure whether my current habits are good. Should I persist or change things up?

I’ll try to be more positive tomorrow.
