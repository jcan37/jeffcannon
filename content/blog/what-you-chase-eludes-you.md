What you desire most seems most likely to come once you stop chasing it.

I really want to create successful businesses and I have been working at this dream for about seven years now without much luck. For much of it, I have been clinging to an outcome. Because of that, it’s been a rollercoaster of hope and disappointment. 

I have become tired of this rollercoaster and started to care less about what happens. I still work at it though because I enjoy the process of making something. Ironically, things seem to be working out much better now that I care less.

But don’t take it from me. Although there’s more promise now, it may still elude me. Take it from people much more successful than me.

From Naval Ravikant:

*The year I generated the most wealth for myself was actually the year I worked the least hard and cared the least about the future. I was mostly doing things for the sheer fun of it. I was basically telling people, “I’m retired, I’m not working.” Then, I had the time for whatever was my highest valued project in front of me. By doing things for their own sake, I did them at their best.*

And Joseph Gordon-Levitt:

*If your creativity is driven by a desire to get attention, you’re never going to be creatively fulfilled.*
