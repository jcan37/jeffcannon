The last landmark for unreasonable success is distorting reality.

Star Trek originated the phrase “reality distortion field”. Steve Jobs was iconically described as distorting reality around him. He would urge engineers to meet deadlines that they thought were impossible. If something was defined as vital, it therefore became possible.

Reality distortion is a two-step process:

1. Project extreme optimism and determination. Do what others think is impossible. Defeat the conventional view of what is realistic and unrealistic.
2. Brainwash brilliant followers or collaborators that they too, can do the impossible. They will believe you because you have a track record of being right.
