I was listening to Seth Godin’s podcast the other day and heard another gem from the genius behind This Is Marketing. I’m sure this was discussed in that book but he reiterated an important point.

Human beings are motivated by two things: affiliation and status.

Affiliation: Who’s in? Who’s out?

Status: Who’s up? Who’s down?

As the creator of an enterprise, you are seeking network effects that pull one or both of these levers to scale your product or service. 

Does your product or service make me an insider or elevate my status in some way? Does sharing your product or service with others make me an insider or elevate my status? These are important questions to ponder for your business to be successful.
