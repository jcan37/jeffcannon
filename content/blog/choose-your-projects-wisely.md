Keep these points in mind when you start your next project:

1. It will take 10x longer than you think it will. If you think it will take 6 months, are you willing to spend 5 years on it?
2. There’s an opportunity cost to saying yes to a project. Working on this one means you have to say no to everything else. Do you really want this one?

Maybe these points are a bit exaggerated but the principle is what’s important. Don’t waste your life working on the wrong projects.
