In any negotiation, the most vital principle to keep in mind is to never look at your counterpart as an enemy. The person across the table is never the problem. The unsolved issue at hand is, so focus on that. 

Treating the other person as if they are against you is toxic to any negotiation. Punching back against an aggressor is a last resort but an attempt at de-escalation is always preferred first. Taking a step back from heated bargaining will help your counterpart regain a sense of agency and control and they will appreciate you for that.

If you can’t come to an agreement, you have to be willing to walk away and it is best to part on good terms. Never be needy for a deal and don’t create enemies.
