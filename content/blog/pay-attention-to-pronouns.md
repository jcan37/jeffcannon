title: Pay attention to pronouns
description: In a negotiation, the more somebody uses first person pronouns like
  “I”, “me” or “my”, the less important that person is in the decision making
  process. Conversely, the less they use first person pronouns, the more
  important they probably are.

In a negotiation, the more somebody uses first person pronouns like “I”, “me” or “my”, the less important that person is in the decision making process. Conversely, the less they use first person pronouns, the more important they probably are. 

Similar to liars distancing themselves from a lie, smart decision makers try to avoid being cornered into making a decision in the moment by deferring to other people. 

If you notice this when dealing with someone then they are probably the person you need to convince.
