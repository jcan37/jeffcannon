title: Care about your customers

One thing that is lacking as companies continue to offer cheaper, faster, easier products is customer service. If you ever have to deal with the customer service of a lot of these new online companies, it feels totally impersonal.

Am I the only person who wants a company to give a shit about me as a customer? I can’t possibly be the only one. Your customers are human-beings; they are not a cost-benefit analysis. Treat them as such.

If you use String Theory and we don’t offer excellent customer service, please call me out on it. This is clearly important enough to me to rant about it and I hope to create businesses that can treat people better.
