There isn’t enough time to write this post. I’ll just get it over with. I have to get to sleep early if I want a shot at being productive tomorrow.

Always anxious. Always stressed. I’m falling behind. I’m not reaching my potential.

Others manage their time better and get more done or have more fun. Should I be optimizing my time for work or play?

I lust for a moment of relaxation except when I get one, I am already thinking about what’s next.

The problem isn’t a lack of time. The problem is how I’m choosing to spend mine.
