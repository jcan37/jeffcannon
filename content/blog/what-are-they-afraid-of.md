A powerful motivation for buying any product or service is to compensate for insecurity. What are the stringers and players of String Theory afraid of?

Our stringers are afraid of obscurity. They are afraid of all of the nuances of creating any sort of business. What started as a desire to get compensated and recognized for being a good stringer has turned out to be more complicated than they thought. They fear the complexities. They are afraid of the responsibility it takes to market oneself. They feel vulnerable. They’re not sure how to get people to trust them and buy their services.

Our players are afraid of playing poorly. They’re afraid of getting cut from the team. They’re afraid of not playing up to their full potential because their stick was not strung the way they are used to. They’re afraid of not using the same cool, new service as their friends.
