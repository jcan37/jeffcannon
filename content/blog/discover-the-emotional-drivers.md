A great salesman does not convince a customer to buy through rational argument. Instead, their job is one of emotional framing around a decision to buy.

If you can get the other person to reveal their problems and pain, then you can get at what they're *really* buying. Sell them a vision of their problem that leaves what you're offering as the perfect solution.

What does a good babysitter sell, really? It isn’t child care, but a relaxed evening. A furnace salesman? Cozy rooms for family time. A locksmith? A feeling of security.

Don’t try to sell someone on the features of your product or service. Sell them on the pain and frustration they are currently experiencing without your solution. What’s in it for them? Why do they *need* you?
