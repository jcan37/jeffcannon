title: Intermittent fasting is dumb
description: When losing weight, meal frequency and timing doesn't matter. Okay,
  that's probably not *totally* true. It might matter slightly but it should not
  be the main mechanism for your fat loss. Because unless you're eating less
  calories, it is not going to do shit.

When losing weight, meal frequency and timing doesn't matter. Okay, that's probably not *totally* true. It might matter slightly but it should not be the main mechanism for your fat loss. Because unless you're eating less calories, it is not going to do shit.

That being said, you should time your meals in a way that makes it easiest for you to stay under your calorie limit and be happily satiated. For me personally, 2 meals per day works best. Not because I'm worried about my insulin spiking in the morning but because I like to have larger meals in a single sitting. I don't wait until a certain time to start eating. I just eat when I'm hungry. And sometimes I'll even have an apple first thing in the morning to start the day.

The only thing that I'm advocating against is creating rules like "you can't eat until 2PM" if that makes you feel like you're suffering through the beginning of your day. If it makes you feel bad, don't do it! You may like to eat more frequently and that's okay. Just keep your calories under your limit and ignore the rest.
