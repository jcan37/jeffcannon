One of the most important qualities to foster is an ability to thrive on setbacks.

Your goal in life is not to remove struggle. Your life *is* struggle and always will be. It can’t be any other way. Without struggle, life is boring. You might as well be dead without something to contend with.

The good news is that you don’t have to do anything to find struggle. Challenges will always find you no matter how many ways you try to surround yourself with security and certainty.

What’s your attitude when you’re facing setbacks? You have a choice. You can be a pessimist or an optimist. You can quit or you can keep going. You can get weaker in the face of adversity or stronger.

There’s zero upside in the former. I know which one I’m choosing. What about you?

When you decide you’re going to be the kind of person who never gives up, failure loses its power to scare you. You love failure because it’s an opportunity to improve.

It’s a tremendously freeing feeling knowing that you have the strength to keep going no matter what.
