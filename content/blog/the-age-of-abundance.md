Only 20 years ago, if you wanted to make a movie, here are some ways you could accomplish your goal:

1. Figure out how to get in front of a movie producer so you can pitch your movie idea and convince them to fund you.
2. Fund the production yourself and pay at least thousands of dollars for equipment.

Once the movie was made, in order to get an audience to see it, you would have to get a distributor or submit it to film festivals and hope it got accepted and the recognition necessary to be distributed.

If you want to make a movie today, your smart phone has a decent enough camera to film it. Additional equipment for audio and lighting might cost you a couple hundred dollars. And once it's made, distributing it could be as easy as uploading it to YouTube or another video streaming site. Like this [video](https://youtu.be/xqiPZBZgW9c).

If you are a creative person, this is the best time to be alive. The Internet is making it impossible for middlemen to survive and get in the way of you distributing your work. The caveat is that it is also easier for everyone else so you have to be exceptional to stand out. 

People who are willing to put in the work to develop the skills to create value for others have more opportunity than ever before.
