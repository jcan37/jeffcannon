I'm a hack. At least for right now. Go to Seth Godin's [blog](seths.blog) and see for yourself. These words are mine but the style is his. It makes sense considering Seth Godin's book is what inspired me to start blogging a few days ago.

One thing I'm struggling with is how I can give value to you as the reader. This blog so far feels very selfish — probably because it is. I'm fleshing out my thoughts like this is a diary but I need to contribute something to you. Otherwise, I'm taking your time without giving something in return and that is an absolute sin. Some ideas for future posts of what I know that may be useful to you:

* Software development - the most obvious one considering it's my day job. It's difficult to think of posts I could write in under 30 minutes but I'm sure there are some.
* Graphic design - I'm self-taught but I design my own websites and apps. I could also offer the unique perspective of a developer who designs their own UI/UX.
* Self improvement - I listen to so many podcasts and read a lot of books on this topic. I most likely won't contribute anything new but maybe it will be new to you.

This blog is going to be a bit all over the place until I discover my own voice. I have no idea when it will happen but I will continue to write everyday until I do. Luckily, I have no audience right now so I have time to figure it out. If you are reading this, you are likely from the future. Greetings from 2020.
