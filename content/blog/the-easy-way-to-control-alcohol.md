I recently read [The Easy Way to Control Alcohol](https://www.amazon.com/Easy-Way-to-Control-Alcohol-audiobook/dp/B00FGC13IK/) by Allen Carr a little over a month ago. I was skeptical and didn't think it would be possible for a book to convince me to stop drinking. However, it was actually quite effective. I don't want to discuss how he did it in case it ruins the magic of the book but I highly recommend it if you're interested.

I was in a situation that I don't think is too uncommon. I would drink casually a few times a week. Most of the time, it wasn't out of control but every once in a while I would have a night of drinking to absolute excess. 

Those nights where I lost control would result in a massive hangover the next day and completely disrupt any positive momentum I had. I would be fooling myself if I thought I could ever live up to my ambitions if I continued to live like that.

There are certainly some aspects to drinking that I miss. The book didn't cure me of that. But I am at least at the point where I'm willing to trade away alcohol for a much better life.
