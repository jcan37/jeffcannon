title: String Theory marketing routine
description: Mondays are for DMs. Who am I sending DMs to?

**Mondays** are for DMs. Who am I sending DMs to?Â 

1. Potential new stringers to on-board onto our site. (From @stringtheory.us)
2. For a limited time while less busy, offer free stringing to new customers to get more people try our service. (From @jeffcanstring)

**Tuesdays** are for posts from my theorist Instagram account (@jeffcanstring).

**Wednesdays** are for @jeffcanstring Instagram community engagement. Do 3 for 7:

1. 7 comments on posts in my main feed.
2. 7 comments on posts in two lacrosse-related hashtags.

**Thursdays** are for posts from the main String Theory Instagram account (@stringtheory.us).

**Fridays** are for @stringtheory.us Instagram community engagement. Do 3 for 7 here too.

A note on Instagram posts: do less business stuff and more fun stuff. People should follow our account because we post cool lacrosse plays or funny lacrosse videos. Only plug the business every once in a while.

I probably have to do more than just these things in any given week but this is the baseline for our marketing.
