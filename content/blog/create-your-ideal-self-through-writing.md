Today is my 30th day of writing in a row and while it is difficult and I don't always feel like doing it, I can already feel that it is changing me in a positive way. I feel like I am getting a clearer picture of who I am and who I want to be. I am grateful for Seth Godin's book *The Practice* for convincing me to write.

Where have you been? Where are you going? Get it out of your head and into writing. Use writing to organize your thoughts and strategize a plan of action. Start with the end in mind and work backwards. 

Writing it out makes it feel real and tangible. When it's written down, It's no longer a fleeting thought. I said that. I wrote that. People saw that I said that. Am I going to be a hypocrite or am I going to live out the story I wrote?
