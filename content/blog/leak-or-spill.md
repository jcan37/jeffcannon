  Frequent eating out, regularly buying material goods like clothes, and too
  many subscription services are all examples of leaks.  A spill is a one-off
  expense in excess. An item you’re considering returning because it didn’t meet
  expectations or a company charging you a hidden fee that you’d like to dispute
  are examples of spills.

A *leak* is a recurring action draining capital from your funds. Frequent eating out, regularly buying material goods like clothes, and too many subscription services are all examples of leaks.

A *spill* is a one-off expense in excess. An item you’re considering returning because it didn’t meet expectations or a company charging you a hidden fee that you’d like to dispute are examples of spills.

Leaks are worth addressing but don’t waste your precious time cleaning up spills.

Value your time highly (over $1000 an hour) and if the amount of money you will get back cleaning up a spill is not greater than the time spent (it usually isn’t) then don’t do it.

Instead, gift items you want to return, let disputes go, and choose not to do future business with these companies.
