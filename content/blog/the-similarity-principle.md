The similarity principle states that we trust people more when we view them as being similar or familiar. People trust those who are in their in-group. 

Similarities as shallow as club memberships or college alumni status increase rapport. That’s why in many cultures negotiators spend large amounts of time building rapport before they even think of offers.

Effective listening is key for using this principle to your advantage in a negotiation. Find out what similarities you share and casually bring them up in conversation to build better rapport with your counterpart. It will lead to better deals.
