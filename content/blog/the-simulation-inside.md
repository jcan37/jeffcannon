Whether or not our minds exist in a simulation outside of ourselves, there is certainly one inside ourselves. We are all living in a simulation of our own creation.

Each of us have very different perceptions of reality. This fact only seems exacerbated by tools like social media. 

One way to measure intelligence is how useful someone's model of reality is in making decisions for the future. If you have an accurate model of reality that allows you to make better predictions for what you should do next, then you are a master of your universe. You can succeed in any way you define success.
