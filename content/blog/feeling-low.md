I feel really unsure of myself right now.

Promoting a business is exhausting. It’s hard to get people’s attention—at least for me it is.

The positive perspective is to view this as a challenge I need to overcome. But I’m doubting my ability to overcome it.

I don’t have anything useful to say today; I just need to vent.

Hopefully, I can look back at this post and laugh because everything worked out.
