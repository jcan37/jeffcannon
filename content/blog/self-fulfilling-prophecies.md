Some things are true only because people believe they are true.

If you believe people can't change, then you can't change. Therefore, you were right! But only because you believed that statement in the first place.

Narratives are extremely powerful. How is it possible for human beings to cooperate on scales much larger than any other species? It is due to our ability to tell stories and spread ideas. Narratives are what make it possible for millions of people to unite and push forward a common cause.

This can be incredibly positive but potentially negative depending on the ideas. So be careful what you choose to believe.
