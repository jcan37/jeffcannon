So many things worth doing suck at first.

Exercising, reading, writing, meditating, creative work, etc. I don’t feel like doing these things everyday. But the more I show up, the easier it gets.

It may not seem like much but daily, consistent practice makes a world of difference.

Get good at doing shit that you don’t want to do.
