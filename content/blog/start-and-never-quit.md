No matter what your vision of success is, there are only two things you need to do to make it happen:

1. **Start right now.** Don’t wait until you are “ready”. Just start doing something.
2. **Never give up.** In most worthwhile pursuits, results don’t come linearly. Expect to grind for years or decades with no progress seeming to be made.

As long as you don’t run out of time (one lifetime should be long enough), have faith that you will get what you want.
