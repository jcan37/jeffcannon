The key to getting in shape is not cutting out all carbs. 

It's also not fasting until 2PM or one day per week. 

Choosing to get in shape using methods like these as the primary driver is beating around the bush. You're avoiding the only thing that matters: if you want to lose weight, you need to consume less energy than you burn. 

Some of these mechanisms can help you do that but they will only work if you're consuming less. So rather than add a bunch of unnecessary rules that might make you unhappy, why not just download MyFitnessPal and count your calories?
