I finally got around to watching [this documentary](https://www.netflix.com/title/81045007) last night. The filmmaker’s obsession and relationship with the octopus is bizarre but I enjoyed it. 

I was very moved by the life of this octopus. The experience of watching this documentary made me reflect on my own mortality.

Life is full of contradictions. Our lives are both insignificant and significant, finite and infinite, simple and complex. We are all connected through this unusual experience of being alive.

In the last entry I wrote, I was stressed and feeling a bit down on myself. I think I’d really benefit from not taking myself so seriously. Eventually, I will learn not to.
