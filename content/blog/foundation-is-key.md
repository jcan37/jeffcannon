There are certain skills that are fundamental to generating wealth. 

If you run a business, you will need to know how to do or hire for specific things like digital marketing or building a website but before approaching any of these specific skills, it is best to have a solid foundation to build upon.

What are the foundational skills to building wealth?

At the highest level, you should have an ability to process and communicate information effectively. This involves listening, reading, and writing. The specifics of how you consistently practice these skills does not matter so long as you do it.

An understanding of human psychology and persuasion is another foundational piece of knowledge. It will be easier and faster to switch between different sales strategies and tactics if you have this high-level understanding.

You should also know how to use computers well. This is a recent development but the Internet provides so much cheap leverage that you would be severely handicapping yourself without it. The better you are at writing and using software, the better off your business will be. Even if you don’t use these skills directly within it, you will be able to better hire or communicate with the people who do.

Specific skills matter but make sure your foundation is solid.
