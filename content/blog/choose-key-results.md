### Step 6: Choose key results

Brainstorm and decide on binary key results that tell you whether or not you've accomplished your vision. 

A good key result...

* ...is binary. You hit it, or you don't.
* ...is quantitative or qualitative.
* ...makes you feel excited!
* ...is a little bit of a stretch.

Know what you want. This is what I want for 2021:

* *Write everyday*
* *Read a book every month*
* *Have one weekly physical activity that isn’t weightlifting or cardio (yoga, martial arts, paddle board, sports, etc.)*
* *Average 7 hours of sleep per night*
* *No hangovers*
* *String Theory: 50 stringers, 100 Premier subscribers, $50K in revenue*
