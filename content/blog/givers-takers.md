The paradigm I have had since I was a kid between good and evil boils down between givers and takers. 

If you’re a giver, you know what I’m talking about. Takers are the people in your life who sense your giver nature and take advantage of it to the point where you feel resentful. You resent them for using you, but mostly you resent yourself because you let them use you.

As a giver, you can become very insecure about this. You may feel like you have to toughen up or stop giving so that people don’t take advantage of you. But hopefully you don’t. You are a good person; don’t hate yourself for that.

When you encounter takers, don’t try to change them. People don’t change from outside pressure. Just take notice that you should cut that person out of your life and keep being the wonderful person you are.
