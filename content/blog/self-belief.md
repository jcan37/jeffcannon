The first and most important landmark on your way to unreasonable success is self-belief.

I’ve already written many times about the superpower of belief but Richard Koch has validated my opinion by defining it as the most important trait of the characters studied in the book who achieved unreasonable success.

“Nobody reaches a target without defining it and believing—sometimes naively and to almost universal ridicule—that it is attainable.”

Winston Churchill wrote his own autobiography a decade before he became Prime Minister.

Albert Einstein discovered his theories of relativity through intuition and thought experiments rather than physical experimentation. He read everything relevant to his investigations but never needed other scientists’ agreement with his theories to come to his own conclusions.

Steve Jobs had always believed he was special.

If you do not believe in yourself, you are certain to fail at achieving unreasonable success.
