Minimum Viable Audience.

When creating a business, what is the smallest number of people you can reach for it to matter? For a restaurant, that might be a few thousand people. For a freelance creative, that might only be a handful of clients.

Counterintuitive, isn’t it? Shouldn’t we be trying to reach the most people in order to have the greatest impact?

Most people want their business to be a hit. The irony is you will probably have more success if you start small and specific. The more specific you are, the deeper you can reach people. 

Seek to have a greater impact for less people.
